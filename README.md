This project aims to predict the stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for sequential data like time series. The dataset used for this project contains historical stock prices for multiple companies over a period of 5 years.

The objective of the project is to:

Preprocess the stock price data, focusing on Apple's historical stock prices.
Build and train an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on past performance.
Evaluate the model using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualize the results to compare predicted stock prices with actual stock prices.
This project showcases the application of LSTM models for time series forecasting, with a focus on financial data.
